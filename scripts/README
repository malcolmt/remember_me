Scripts and support files for setting up dev environment. Assumes dev machine has pip and virtualenv installed.

Run it as "./create.sh <dirname>" where <dirname> is the name of the virtualenv directory (doesn't have to exist initially).

TODO: Check out a copy of the final project inside the virtualenv as well. (Not needed during initial development.)
